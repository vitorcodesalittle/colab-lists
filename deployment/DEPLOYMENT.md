# Deployment

Deployment details, including AWS cloudformation YAML that does all the job,
are in the notion page [here](https://www.notion.so/AWS-Cloudformation-Colablists-10b954bb298180fba86cc228f3fa83eb)
because I didn't want to pay 80 cents a month for storing secrets, so I kept them in
direclty in the cloudformation template.

## Roadmap:

- [x] Scripts to setup the EC2 instance
- [x] Setup domain name
- [x] Setup EC2 Volume
- [x] setup HTTPS
- [ ] setup ci/cd -- build and push image to ghcr
